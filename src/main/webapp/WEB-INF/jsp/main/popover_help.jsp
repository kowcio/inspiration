             <br />Once you and your team member have explored the current reality, it's time to determine what is possible    
             <br /> meaning all of the possible options for reaching her objective.    
             <br />Brainstorm as many good options as possible. Then, discuss these and decide on the best ones.    
             <br />By all means, offer your own suggestions in this step. But let your team member offer suggestions    
             <br />first, and let her do most of the talking. It's important to guide her in the right direction,    
             <br />without actually making decisions for her.   
             <br />Typical questions that you can use to explore options are as follows:

             <br /> That's great but in itself, this may not be enough. The final step is to get your    
             <br /> team member to commit to specific actions in order to move forward towards his goal.   
             <br /> In doing this, you will help him establish his will and boost his motivation.

        The <br />
        G.R.O.W.</center>
        <br />  model (or process) is a technique for problem solving or goal setting. 
                It was developed in the United Kingdom and was used extensively in the corporate 
                coaching market in the late 1980s/1990s.
        <br /><br />
                There have been many claims to authorship of GROW as a way of achieving goals and solving problems.
                While no one person can be clearly identified as the originator Graham Alexander, Alan Fine, 
                Sir John Whitmore who are well known in the world of coaching, made significant contributions. 
                Max Landsberg also describes GROW in his book The Tao of Coaching.
<br />
<br />  GROW is very well known in the business arena but it also has many applications in everyday life.
        The particular value of GROW is that it provides an effective, structured methodology which both 
        helps set goals effectively and is a problem solving process.
<br />
<br />  It can be used by anyone without special training. While there are many methodologies that can be used to address problems, 
        the value of GROW is that it is easily understood, straightforward to apply and very thorough. 
        In addition it is possible to apply it to a large variety of circumstances in a very effective way.
<br /><br />
        There are a number of different versions of the GROW model. 
        This version presents one view of the stages but there are others. The 'O' in this version has two meanings.
<br /><br />
<table>        
<tr><td>G</td><td>Goal</td><td>     This is the end point, where the client wants to be. The goal has to be defined in such a way that it is very clear to the client when they have achieved it.
</td></tr><tr>
<td>R</td><td>Reality</td><td>  The Current Reality is where the client is now. What are the issues, the challenges, how far are they away from their goal?
</td></tr><tr>
<td rowspan="2">O</td><td>  Obstacles</td><td>  There will be Obstacles stopping the client getting from where they are now to where they want to go. If there were no Obstacles the client would already have reached their goal.
</td></tr><tr>
<td>Options</td><td>    Once Obstacles have been identified, the client needs to find ways of dealing with them if they are to make progress. These are the Options.
</td></tr><tr>
<td>W</td><td>Way Forward</td><td>  As with many simple principles any user of GROW can apply a great deal of skill and knowledge at each stage but the basic process remains as written above. There are numerous questions which the coach could use at any point and part of the skill of the coach is to know which questions to use and how much detail to uncover.
